# -Sustainability-Linked-Loans-SLLs-pricing-simulator
This is the SLL Pricing Simulator — an interactive financial tool that demonstrates how Sustainability-Linked Loans (SLLs) can lower the cost of capital for Indian renewable energy projects (solar &amp; wind).
What it does:
Configure a project — pick solar/wind, an Indian state, capacity, loan terms, and SLL covenant parameters (step-down/up basis points tied to CUF targets)
Run a simulation — compares a Traditional Loan vs. an SLL side-by-side, showing WACC, NPV, interest rate, and lifetime savings
View live metrics — simulated CUF, irradiance/wind speed, RBI repo rate, and carbon prices
Generate an investment memo — a printable summary with executive summary, sensitivity analysis, and project parameters
Core financial concepts:
WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital) reduction through SLL margin step-downs
CUF (Capacity Utilization Factor) as the KPI covenant — meet your target → lower interest rate
NPV and total interest savings over the loan tenor
Who it's for:
Sustainable finance professionals, renewable energy developers, and lenders evaluating how linking loan margins to environmental performance creates value for both sides.

Developed by Jasleen Kaur, MBA student in Development & Sustainable Finance.
 Full Flow Test Complete
Test: 200MW Wind Park, Tamil Nadu (ended up testing 180MW Rajasthan due to dropdown behavior)

Results verified:
✅ Configuration — Wind Park, state selection, capacity slider, loan params all work
✅ Dashboard — Live KPI cards (CUF 28.3%, Wind Speed, RBI Rate, Carbon Price), Loan Comparison table, bar chart, sensitivity analysis
✅ Financial calculations — Traditional 9.50% → SLL 9.05% (−45 bps), WACC 8.84% → 8.59%, ₹42.62 Cr lifetime savings
✅ Investment Memo — Executive summary, project parameters, sensitivity table, print/PDF button
🐛 Fixed — Project name now correctly reflects capacity set at simulation time
